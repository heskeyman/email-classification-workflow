## 🎯 What It Does

This workflow monitors a Gmail inbox and automatically:

1. **Receives** incoming emails in real-time
2. **Analyzes** the sender, subject, and body content
3. **Classifies** each email into one of 6 departments
4. **Forwards** the email to the correct department's inbox

### Supported Departments

| Department | Example Triggers |
|---|---|
| 💼 **Sales** | Pricing requests, bulk orders, quotes, proposals |
| 🎧 **Customer Service** | Complaints, refunds, returns, support tickets |
| 👥 **Human Resources** | Job applications, resumes, interviews, leave requests |
| 💰 **Finance** | Invoices, payments, billing, budget reviews |
| 🏭 **Operations** | Shipping, logistics, warehouse, inventory updates |
| 📂 **Other** | Emails that don't match any department |

### Hybrid Classification Approach

The system uses a **two-tier classification strategy**:

**Tier 1 — Rule-Based Engine (Free & Instant)**
- Scores emails against 150+ keywords across 5 departments
- 3-layer scoring: body keywords (1pt), subject patterns (2pts), sender patterns (3pts)
- If score ≥ 3 AND confidence ≥ 50% → classification is trusted

**Tier 2 — AI Fallback (Groq / Llama 3.1)**
- Only triggered for ambiguous emails that rules can't confidently classify
- Uses Groq's free API (14,400 requests/day)
- Returns structured JSON: `{department, confidence, reason}`

This hybrid approach handles **~80% of emails for free** with rules, and only sends ambiguous ones to AI.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- Gmail account with OAuth2 credentials
- Groq API key (free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com))

### Installation

1. **Clone this repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/email-classification-workflow.git
```

2. **Import into n8n**
   - Open n8n → Workflows → Import from File
   - Select `workflow.json`

3. **Configure credentials**
   - Gmail OAuth2 → connect to all Gmail nodes (7 total)
   - Groq API key → paste in the "Groq AI Classify" HTTP Request node header

4. **Set forwarding addresses**
   - Update the "Send To" field in each of the 6 Forward nodes

5. **Activate & test**
   - Send a test email → watch it classify and route

## 📊 Scoring System

The rule-based classifier uses a weighted scoring system:

| Match Type | Points | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Keyword in email body | 1 point | "invoice" found in body |
| Keyword in subject line | 2 points | "payment" in subject |
| Sender email pattern | 3 points | Email from `hr@company.com` |

**Decision threshold:** Score ≥ 3 AND Confidence ≥ 50% → use rules. Otherwise → send to AI.

### Keywords Per Department

**💼 Sales:** `buy`, `purchase`, `order`, `pricing`, `quote`, `discount`, `deal`, `offer`, `proposal`, `contract`, `subscription`, `upgrade`, `demo`, `trial`, `wholesale`, `partnership`, `negotiate`, `bid`

**🎧 Customer Service:** `complaint`, `issue`, `problem`, `broken`, `defective`, `return`, `refund`, `exchange`, `help`, `support`, `damaged`, `warranty`, `feedback`, `disappointed`, `frustrated`, `escalate`, `ticket`

**👥 Human Resources:** `job`, `resume`, `cv`, `interview`, `hiring`, `recruit`, `vacancy`, `application`, `candidate`, `employee`, `payroll`, `leave`, `benefits`, `insurance`, `salary`, `compensation`, `career`

**💰 Finance:** `invoice`, `payment`, `billing`, `account`, `tax`, `budget`, `expense`, `reimbursement`, `receipt`, `financial`, `audit`, `profit`, `loss`, `balance`, `accounting`, `payable`, `credit`, `bank`, `transfer`

**🏭 Operations:** `logistics`, `shipping`, `warehouse`, `inventory`, `delivery`, `dispatch`, `fleet`, `maintenance`, `equipment`, `production`, `manufacturing`, `safety`, `compliance`, `fulfillment`, `distribution`, `freight`

## 🔧 Customization

### Add a New Department
1. Add keywords to the **Rule Classifier** code node
2. Add a new output to the **Switch** node
3. Add a new **Gmail Send** node
4. Connect the switch output → new forward node

### Change the AI Model
Edit the `model` field in the Build AI Request code node:
```javascript
model: "llama-3.1-8b-instant"    // Fast, free
model: "llama-3.1-70b-versatile" // More accurate, still free
model: "mixtral-8x7b-32768"     // Good for multilingual
```

### Adjust Classification Sensitivity
```javascript
var needsAI = (maxScore < 3) || (confidence < 50);
//                        ↑                    ↑
//              Lower = more AI          Lower = more AI
//              Higher = more rules      Higher = more rules
```
